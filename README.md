# Alumni Management App

The Alumni Management App is a beginner-level Flask application created as part of the [Jovian Free Flask Introductory Course](https://jovian.com/learn/web-development-with-python-and-flask). It serves as a learning project to understand the basics of Flask framework and web development with Python. The app allows users to register and log in as alumni, download their certificates and degrees from the dashboard, and enables outside users to verify degree details using the document ID.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Registered alumni have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view and manage their profile, certificates, and degrees. They can download their documents in a digital format.

- **Document Verification**: External users can verify the authenticity of certificates and degrees by entering the document ID. This feature helps prevent fraud and ensures the credibility of the issued documents.
